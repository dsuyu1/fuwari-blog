# Hello everybody!
My name is Damian Villarreal! I've made this blog to document my past, current, and future endeavors in the computer science and cybersecurity world. 

My main objectives with this blog are:
- Document all my projects extensively.
- Promote myself and my research.
- Explain who I am and what I'm interested in.

Feel free to connect with me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsuyu/)! If you have any ideas in mind, please do not hesitate to contact me. My inbox is always open, and I'm always looking for new opportunities to meet new people.

Solving real-world problems is the main motivation behind my work. I hope that everything I do can serve as either inspiration or a tool that others can use. Through this blog, I hope I can reach the minds of others, and ultimately, help them learn something new! As my previous teachers and professors have done for me, I hope I can start a spark in others as well. I know it's a big dream, but if I were to have one thing, it's big aspirations.

Thank you for your time, and I hope you enjoy what I have to say! 💌
