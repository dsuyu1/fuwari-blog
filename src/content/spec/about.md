# About
I'm an undergraduate Computer Science student at the University of Texas Rio Grande Valley, graduating in Spring 2026. Currently, I work as a Student Analyst at the Regional Security Operations Center (RSOC) and conduct research in various topics.

My work centers around building secure, privacy-first systems for real-world applications. I'm particularly passionate about crytography, security automation, and exploring how emerging technologies like blockchain can solve current and future security challenges.

I find the most enjoyment working with others! As niche as it is, teamwork really does make the dream work when it comes to academia and the professional life. 

In my free time, I like to study Korean (I actually studied abroad, you can read more about that [here!](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dsuyu_korea2025-activity-7348057640855400452-Ga50?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop&rcm=ACoAAD3EH-wBMf_Db8oezWHhZhrfPkUKlLF9vhI)), spend time at the park, and listen to music. I'm a native Spanish and English speaker, so becoming fluent in Korean would make me trilingual! 

I'm always open to new opportunities, collaborations, and conversations! Whether you have a project idea or just want to chat about anything, feel free to reach out through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dsuyu) or check out my work on [GitHub](https://github.com/dsuyu1).
