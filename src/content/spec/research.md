# Research

I'm interested in research that concerns theoretical computer science, cybersecurity, and agentic AI. I'm drawn most, however, to projects that involve working with other passionate researchers and present interesting challenges and opportunities!

## Current Work

### Zero-Trust Edge Camera for Privacy Preserving Surveillance

**Research Area:** IoT Security • Blockchain • Privacy Engineering

**Status:** Ongoing

:::note[ABSTRACT]
As the number of Internet of Things (IoT) devices keeps growing, security is becoming more of a concern. With trade-offs like complexity and scalability, maintaining privacy in the system is a highly desired characteristic. This work presents an architecture for the management of CCTV devices with Hyperledger Fabric. We aim to use blockchain as our backbone to implement a privacy-first solution featuring zero-trust architecture and real-time face blurring performed directly on the device. This guarantees robust data protection for critical infrastructure throughout the entire data lifecycle—in storage, in use, and in transit—ensuring privacy persists despite compromise or a malicious actor.

## Conference Presentations

### Zero-Trust at the Edge: Privacy-First Security for IoT Surveillance
**Region One ESC Cybersecurity Summit** • Edinburg, TX • Oct 30, 2025  
📊 [View Slides](https://www.canva.com/design/DAG3MFzARPc/LbZn3UGeutN40iEOIY64Lg/edit?utm_content=DAG3MFzARPc&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link2&utm_source=sharebutton)

:::note[SUMMARY]
Presented a security-focused approach to IoT surveillance that addresses the vulnerabilities of traditional perimeter-based security models. The talk covered how blockchain-backed zero-trust architecture combined with edge computing can protect sensitive video data throughout its entire lifecycle—even in distributed, cloud-based environments where defining security perimeters is impractical. Demonstrated real-time privacy preservation techniques and explained how our framework ensures data protection despite potential system compromise.
